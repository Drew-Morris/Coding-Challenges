# ROMAN NUMERALS TO DECIMAL CONVERSION
This challenge was to write a program to convert roman numeral strings into
decimal numbers.
I completed this challenge in 2 hours, 52 minutes, and 33 seconds.
My code supports input from standard input and file input via command line
arguments.
I have also written my own test cases and makefile.
